# malTipper
CapTipper is a python tool to analyze, explore and revive HTTP malicious traffic.
CapTipper sets up a web server that acts exactly as the server in the PCAP file,
and contains internal tools, with a powerful interactive console, for analysis and inspection of the hosts, objects and conversations found.

The following project aims to create CapTipper output into Maltego to provide a visual analysis of PCAP files.
